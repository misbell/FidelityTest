It was easy enough to do, and stuff I'd done before. I had to remember how to do it.

1. so the first thing I did was find an app that showed a list, I grabbed that code, to remind myself about ForEach and identity (id).

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/displaying-data-in-lists

2. second thing I did was go to HWS and find a Codable from URL example.

3 third thing was I ran the fake JSON through my favorite Json-to-Codable parser

https://app.quicktype.io

and copied and pasted the Codable structs into the code (turned out they were the same ones I wrote by hand, but I wanted to be sure)

4. then I modified the code to work. What took me the longest was remembering to put [] around Reponse.self, as in

[Response].self,

The rest I did in about 15 minutes, after having not looked at Codable for 2 years. :-)
